*! Don't put the widgets inside unbounded parents. You don't need scrollables anymore (e.g. `SingleChildScrollView`) - widgets handle scrolling by theirselves. If you need a widget inside a `Column()`, wrap it into `Expanded()` or `Flexible()`.*

In-place substitute for Flutter's stock **DataTable** and **PaginatedDataTable** widgets with fixed/sticky header/top rows and left columns. A few useful features missing in the originals were added. 

**DataTable2** and **PaginatedDataTable2** widgets are based on the sources of Flutter's originals, mimic the API and provide seamless integration.

If you've been using (or considered using) standard Flutter's widgets for displaying tables or data grids and missed the sticky headers (or vertical borders, 'No rows' placeholder, straightforward async data source API etc.) - you've come to the right place. No need to learn yet another API of a new control, just stick to well described DataTable and PaginatedDataTable.

# [LIVE DEMO](https://maxim-saplin.github.io/data_table_2/)

Please check the [example folder](https://github.com/maxim-saplin/data_table_2/tree/main/example) which demonstrates various features of the widgets. There's also a [DataGrid Sample](https://maxim-saplin.github.io/flutter_web_spa_sample/canvaskit/) in separate repo which is based on `DataTable2`.

## Extra Features
- Sticky headers and paginator (when using `PaginatedDataTable2`)
  - The number of sticky rows is defined by `DataTable2.fixedTopRows`
  - Sticky left columns `DataTable2.fixedLeftColumns`
- Vertically scrollable main area (with data rows)
  - `autoRowsToHeight` property on PaginatedDataTable2 allows to auto calculate page size depending on how much rows fit the height and makes vertical scrolling unnecessary
- All columns are fixed width, table automatically stretches horizontally, individual column's width is determined as **(Width)/(Number of Columns)**
  - Should you want to adjust sizes of columns, you can replace `DataColumn` definitions with `DataColumn2` (which is a descendant of DataColumn). The class provides `size` property which can be set to one of 3 relative sizes (S, M and L)
  - Width ratios between Small and Medium, Large and Medium columns are defined by `smRatio` and `lmRatio` params
  - `fixedWidth` parameter allows to define absolute value for column width
  - You can limit the minimal width of the control and scroll it horizontally if the viewport is narrower (by setting `minWidth` property) which is useful in portrait orientations with multiple columns not fitting the screen
  - You can add bottom margin (by setting `bottomMargin` property) to allow slight over-scroll
  - Fixed width columns are faster than default implementation of DataTable which does 2 passes to determine contents size and justify column widths
- Data rows are wrapped in `Flexible` and `SingleScrollView` widgets to allow widget to fill parent container and be scrollable
  - Vertical scroller is exposed via table's `scrollController` property. See example 'DataTable2 - Scroll-up' which shows 'up' button when scrolling down and allows to jump to the top of the table
  - `PaginatedDataTable2.fit` property controls whether the paginator sticks to the bottom and leaves a gap to data rows above
- There's `DataRow2` alternative to stock `DataRow` which provides row level tap events (including right clicks)
  - `DataRow2.specificRowHeight` allows overriding default height for any row
- Overriding sort arrows via `sortArrowIcon` and `sortArrowAnimationDuration` properties
- `empty` property which allows defining a placeholder widget to be displayed when data source is empty
- `border` allows drawing inner and outer vertical and horizontal borders (e.g. outlining individual cells) - stock widgets only allow drawing horizontal row splitters
- `PaginatorController` allows to externally control `PaginatedDataTable2` state (e.g. switch pages, change page size etc.)
- **Experimental `AsynPaginatedDataTable2` widget built for asynchronous scenarios (such a requesting data from a web service) relying on `AsyncDataTableSource` returning rows in a `Future`**


## Usage

**NOTE:*** don't put the widgets into any unconstrained parents with infinite width or height (e.g. scrollables such as SingleChildScrollView, Column etc.). The widgets are designed to stretch and fill all available space within parent and have a number of own scrollables inside to address fixed rows/columns feature. Putting it inside unconstrained parent break widgets.

1. Add reference to pubspec.yaml.

2. Import:
```dart
import 'package:data_table_2/data_table_2.dart';
```

3. Code:
```dart
import 'package:data_table_2/data_table_2.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/rendering.dart';

/// Example without a datasource
class DataTable2SimpleDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  const DataTable2SimpleDemo();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
      child: DataTable2(
          columnSpacing: 12,
          horizontalMargin: 12,
          minWidth: 600,
          columns: [
            DataColumn2(
              label: Text('Column A'),
              size: ColumnSize.L,
            ),
            DataColumn(
              label: Text('Column B'),
            ),
            DataColumn(
              label: Text('Column C'),
            ),
            DataColumn(
              label: Text('Column D'),
            ),
            DataColumn(
              label: Text('Column NUMBERS'),
              numeric: true,
            ),
          ],
          rows: List<DataRow>.generate(
              100,
              (index) => DataRow(cells: [
                    DataCell(Text('A' * (10 - index % 10))),
                    DataCell(Text('B' * (10 - (index + 5) % 10))),
                    DataCell(Text('C' * (15 - (index + 5) % 10))),
                    DataCell(Text('D' * (15 - (index + 10) % 10))),
                    DataCell(Text(((index + 0.1) * 25.4).toString()))
                  ]))),
    );
  }
}

```
If you're already using the standard widgets you can reference the package and add '2' to the names of stock widgets (making them **DataTable2** or **PaginatedDataTable2**) and that is it. 

##  Know issues/limitations/caveats
- Paginated tables always have 1 fixed row and no fixed columns, might be added soon
- There's no capability to size data table cells to fit contents. Column width's adapt to available width (either to parent width or `minWidth`), data rows width are predefined by constructor params. Content that doesn't fit a cell gets clipped
- There're no expanding/collapsing rows (drill-down scenarios), manually moving or resizing columns or rows, merging cells (i.e. HTML's colspan, rowspan)
- When fixing left columns, hovering over rows doesn't highlight entire row (should there be any tap handlers standard behavior is hovering a row changes it background)
 - With fixed top rows and left columns hovering over actionable data rows their highlighted background can be displayed behind fixed sections
 - Touch scrolling not working/jumping under mobile device emulation in Chrome (https://github.com/maxim-saplin/data_table_2/issues/100)
 - Cell and row tap events block `DataRow.onSelectChanged` event handler
 - In order to get checkbox column visible it is necessary to have `DataTable2.showCheckboxColumn` set to true AND there must be some rows with `onSelectChanged` event handler being not null
